		<description><![CDATA[Visited today with great anticipation. Really picked the wrong day. Was so hot the staff was offering sunblock to people waiting in line. After waiting over an hour in 29 degree heat we      entered this iron building that was sweltering inside. Didn&#039;t really      enjoy trying to explore because of the extreme heat and it became more of a race to find the exit. Might have been different on a cooler day but we left overheated and disappointed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been a while, and I can&#039;t seem to recall the date when we last laughed and dined in Wellington. It was also during one of your motorcycle adventures, I think. 
There is no need to reply to this, I only wanted to let you know that I have been frequenting this site since you mentioned it. I started reading &#039;The Lap&#039; in Singapore (in Oct) and re-read it all again today. I am envious, grateful for the laughter, impressed by the military precision/planning/slang/equipment etc, impressed by the coffee making ritual, and enlightened by the photos and descriptions (especially about yoga and moksha). 
This will inspire and motivate readers to drop &#039;the-everyday-things&#039; and pursue a &#039;mid-life-crisis&#039; type of adventure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting how different people are - in general.
In contrast to your comments about being comfortable while away from home-base, personally, this aspect of being homesick almost ruined my own experience of riding the Big Loop, which I completed recently. I must add that it wasn&#039;t just the unknown of where/what everyday, under the stars, because I have been a Gallivanter and a Solivagant for some four decades, on different budgets, sometimes in great comfort. I have concluded I don&#039;t like being away from home and that I miss my Family whenever I am away for more then a night.
Congratulations on your achievements, Lincoln.
Well done and nicely written.
Link below to my Big Loop Ride posts. (It looks horrible, I assure you it&#039;s safe and clean to open.)
Kind Regards;
Tom.
