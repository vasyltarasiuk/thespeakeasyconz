<p>I’ll be honest, I wasn’t sure what to expect when entering the Loft at Q Theatre to watch <a href="https://www.qtheatre.co.nz/shows/inflated-rebel">INFLATED REBEL</a>. Held as part of Q Theatre&#8217;s &#8216;Q Matchbox 2021&#8217;, on finding my seat I was greeted to a stage that was wrapped in white sheets that draped and folded; the simple, thoughtful set design immediately gave the feeling that we had all stepped into some private realm that we were lucky to have been invited in to.</p>
<p>Perfectly in sync, choreographers, and performers Jessie McCall and Rose Philpott created a sensual, spontaneous lens in which to highlight and share their explorations into queerness, feminism, the body, and the system. The swells of audience support throughout the performance confirmed its resonance. The performance was both intimate and affirming, challenging and captivating &#8211; live theatre at its very best.</p>
<p>With New Zealand back in lockdown just days after the opening night I’m reminded how important the arts and the ability to showcase physical expression is. Philpott and McCall have created a beautiful musing, that encourages the audience to ask questions of themselves and to dig into the complexities of identity and introspection. If you’re looking for an artistic performance to absorb and contemplate, then <a href="https://www.qtheatre.co.nz/shows/inflated-rebel">INFLATED REBEL</a> is for you.</p>

<p><em><strong>Reviewer: Jordon&nbsp;Houston</strong></em></p>



<p>Tea, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Kali ma!), impersonations, and live music. <strong><em>The Mourning After</em></strong> brings all of these and much more to the intimate Loft stage at the Q Theatre. </p>



<p>Reading the synopsis, I wasn’t
entirely sure about how much I’d enjoy a one man show. Personally, I get images
of overly artistic productions designed solely for theatre enthusiasts.
However, I found myself pleasantly surprised. This show has a personality of
its own and perfectly balances the comedic aspects of a quirky homecoming and
the tragic aftermath of a natural disaster. </p>



<p>The experience of The Mourning
After begins before you even hit your seat. You are welcomed with tea and asked
to remove your shoes before entering the theatre. As you enter, you are greeted
with music from the live band of four fantastically talented musicians. All
this creates a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere which perfectly sets the
viewer up for what is about to unfold.</p>



<p>The story is presented through the
perspective of kiwi-born Shekar as he retells the story of his journey to Sri
Lanka following his father’s death. Over the next 70 minutes you are introduced
to a slew of cooky yet loveable, and downright hilarious characters. Each
masterfully written by Writer and Director, Ahi Karunaharan, each feeling
unique and very much alive. Of course, while the writing certainly contributes
to this, the impressive acting on display by solo performer Jehangir Homavazir
must also be commended. Jehangir puts his all into each of these personalities.
Complete with distinctive accents and body language, it is always clear who is being
referenced throughout. For one actor to bring to life so perfectly such as
range of character is impressive.</p>



<p>The emphasis on the characters is
only accentuated by the simplistic stage design. The stage is dominated by a
square of sand, with four groups of props at each corner. To the right there is
a constant stream of sand drifting from above. None of this ever distracts from
the performer. </p>



<p>The same emphasis is also brought to
the music. Atmospheric and complementary to the story throughout the entire
runtime. The live music brings levity, tension, and, at times, suspense, to the
storytelling. I found it thoroughly enjoyable and made it feel at times like a
camp-fire story on steroids. </p>



<p>The Mourning After is clearly a
deeply personal story, one that I’m sure many from Sri Lanka can relate to. The
writing never feels too tragic nor too comedic, it’s just right in every way.
It projects you into Sri Lanka following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami but
chooses not to focus on the devastation, rather its emphasis is on the people.
This show is not one to miss and its unique style is sure to leave a lasting
impression. I can wholeheartedly recommend that you go out and see The Mourning
After. </p>

<p>The first person that immediately came to mind for the +1 ticket that came with this review was my flat mate Nic. One of my best friends who also happen to be an hospo worker on shift that evening, that option was out. Unfortunate.</p>



<p>Because they would&#8217;ve thoroughly enjoyed the chaos that is <strong>Inhospitable</strong> &#8211; equal parts social commentary, comedy, and just downright calling people out. I&#8217;ll get to that last bit in a second.</p>



<p>Billing itself as a &#8220;one-hour comedy/drama stage show about making bad decisions&#8221;, <strong>Inhospitable</strong> presents audiences with a gamut of characters that wouldn&#8217;t be out of place in some boozy venue, downtown Auckland.</p>



<p>Heading into this without having read the blurb &#8211; well, much of anything to do with the show, let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; for the first 10 minutes I had wondered if it was just a slew of asshole-impersonations.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; this was some seriously impressive acting from leads Aaron Richardson and Kalyani Nagarajan. Throughout the hour-long show they slowly reveal a full list of characters that will lead to either choking on your drink, dying of laughter, or a sober dose of reality. But by the end, as the story unravels and the characters&#8217; stories laid bare, there will be much to think about.</p>



<p>From epic soliloquys about the yardie to beautifully acted renditions of entitled assholes (both genders are covered, don&#8217;t worry), the pair recreate a fair slice of the Kiwi punters that stroll down the viaduct on a Friday night for a drink, or two, or too many.</p>



<p>Both Richardson and Nagarajan pull no punches, with subtle changes to language and body posture to differentiate between characters. Their only props are two stools and a couple of towels.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s incredible acting that fits perfectly into the small space at <strong>The&nbsp;Basement&nbsp;Theatre&#8217;s</strong> upstairs studio stage. The physical intimacy allows audiences to pick up on minute nuances as the pair switch in-and-out between characters, their voices reaching the back of the seating barely breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>Directed by industry veteran Donna Brookbanks, it&#8217;s a powerhouse piece of theatre that not only delves down to what&#8217;s wrong with our individual entitlement and the way we treat our hospo workers, but also the way we treat each other. It&#8217;s all a bit bleak, the show seems to say, and we probably need to rethink how our society deems servers as less-than-nothing.</p>



<p>To be honest, it&#8217;s fair critique and probably one of the reasons I don&#8217;t head out much these days. Audiences who work in hospo will probably delight in the exposé of these nightmare stories that I&#8217;ve been privy to (thanks Nic!), but it really raises some hard-hitting questions.</p>



<p>Of what, I&#8217;ll let audiences be the judge of, but it certainly got me thinking about the nights seeing my friend come home, absolutely defeated by the world and some of the hateful people in it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not right. It&#8217;s not fair. But few care.</p>



<p>The best realisations also happen to be wrapped in dying-of-laughter humour. As Nagaranjan pulls off the most delicious rendition of &#8220;trashed Ponsonby white girl&#8221;, an audience member in the row directly in front of me whispers to their friend a little too loudly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, fuck, bro, that&#8217;s me!&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought it best not to be nosy and ask who said that at the end of the show as we all single-filed down the staircase and out into the night. Before walking to the bus stop and saying goodbye to another old friend that had taken the +1, we both agreed that the first third of the show got the most laughs.</p>



<p>But it was the last third that really hit hard with a punch to the gut. That maybe everyone has their own story, and we ought to be a bit nicer to each other. Stranger, or otherwise.</p>

<p style="text-align:center" class="has-medium-font-size">After wowing crowds across New Zealand on her recent tour with LAIIKA,  Georgia Lines has released the stunning accompanying video for her new single, ‘No One Knows’.</p>



<p>The incredible dance movement video stars <strong>Georgia</strong> <strong>Lines</strong> and has been choreographed by another amazing Aotearoa artist, <strong>Chelsea Jade. </strong>The video for<em> ‘No One Knows’ i</em>s the perfect visual reflection of the song vibe, all brought together by the vision of videographer, <strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Gandar</strong>.<br><br> <em>“When I first listened to the song I heard the quality that all great pop bangers have &#8211; a knife-edge tension between elation and despair,”</em> says Gandar.</p>

<p><br><br> <em>“You don’t know whether to cry or dance, so you do both. For me sadness and silliness are only ever a heartbeat away from each other in the emotional spectrum, so I wanted the video to exist in the same space: a strange melancholia punctuated by bursts of sad clown dancing. My long-time visual collaborator Chelsea Jade (the N.Z. / U.S. multi-talented pop titan) came on board as our choreographer, and she and Georgia instantly clicked, and over a few intense rehearsals they devised this beautifully weird routine that I love. Georgia told us she’d never really danced before. I’m not sure I believe her.”</em><br><br> The song ‘No One Knows’ intricately weaves together Lines’ exquisite vocals with production that moves seamlessly between delicate, quiet moments and soaring, uplifting energy; making for a heartwarming and affirming track that leaves you wanting more.<br><br> <em>“I loved working with Alexander and hope we get to work together again,” </em>says Georgia Lines of the experience. <br><br> <em>“He’s such an incredible human with amazing ideas and has an incredible way of bringing those ideas into reality! Not many people would think of putting my face onto my own thumb&#8230; it’s brilliant and hilarious and the whole video is something I’m so proud of. He pushed me out of my comfort zone, but in a way that I felt supported and encouraged and was such a fun video to create together! The whole concept is incredible and feels like a big leap forward,”</em> Lines continues.<br><br> <em>“Chelsea Jade was amazing to work with too and I felt so privileged to have her choreograph the dance and help me learn it. I don’t consider myself much of a dancer but she was so encouraging and made it achievable for me to learn and execute well. Having her on set was so amazing too! I don’t think I could have done it without her. She’s amazing and such an incredible artist herself.”</em><br><br> Co-written and produced by the award-winning <strong>Djeisan</strong> <strong>Suskov</strong> (<strong>BENEE, Matthew Young, Mitch James, LEISURE</strong>), ‘No One Knows’ sets the scene for the year ahead and follows the 2020 release of Georgia’s debut self-titled EP, which contained the hit singles ‘My Love’, ‘Vacant Cities’ and ‘Never Had Love’.</p>

<p style="font-size:24px;text-align:center"><strong>LADYHAWKE ANNOUNCES NEW ALBUM, SINGLE AND TOUR!</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>WHEN &amp; WHERE</strong><br><br>Thursday, 14th October &#8211; San Fran, Wellington<br>Friday, 15th October &#8211; James Hay Theatre, Christchurch<br>Saturday, 16th October &#8211; Hollywood Theatre, Auckland<br><br><strong>TICKETS</strong><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ladyhawkemusic.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>2021 is a comeback year for Ladyhawke (‘Pip’ Brown) with her single ‘Guilty Love’, a collaboration with BROODS topping Triple J’s most played list and clocking over 1 Million streams. Now the follow-up single ‘Mixed Emotions’ is released today, the second single from her anticipated forthcoming album TIME FLIES, which will be released on Friday, October 8.<br><br> 
 
Pip says about the new single, “Mixed Emotions was written with old mates Jono Sloan and Nick Littlemore while I was on a writing trip in LA. Sloan had come up with a really cool bass groove which Nick and I riffed over to get the lyrics and melody. The song is about all the things you can feel with one person, sometimes all in a single day. Ups and downs, confusion, highs, and lows. And everything in between!”<br><br>

The past year has also felt like a rebirth to Pip. After several years of challenging health issues (including post-natal depression and being diagnosed and treated for skin cancer), when she embarked on writing songs for this new record in 2019, there was a sense of freedom in the work.<br><br> 

“I was feeling pretty grateful to be alive and making music, so I felt like I didn’t ‘care’ anymore &#8211; not in a bad way, I just stopped over thinking it.”<br><br>

She also started regular therapy towards the end of 2019 and continued to see her therapist via Zoom throughout the pandemic, and also began taking medication for the first time, all of which contributed to her positive outlook.<br><br> 

“I’ve had depression and anxiety for a long time and always been really open about it. I started therapy in Nov 2019 regularly. I had reached the bottom, I realised I needed help, and I was recommended someone through a friend, who was used to talking to artists and creative people.<br><br>

“It felt like last year I changed my whole life. I decided to try medication for the first time, and it turned everything around and made me feel like a haven&#8217;t in a long time. My mum said she hasn’t seen me like this since I was 17.”<br><br>

With the above-mentioned collaborations with Littlemore and Sloan, Pip has also formed strong bonds with a number of other collaborators such as LA songwriter and producer Tommy English (K.Flay, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kacey Musgraves, Adam Lambert, Broods etc); Auckland based Josh Fountain (Leisure, Benee) and Jeremy Toy (Leonard Charles, She’s So Rad) and Sydney&#8217;s Chris Stracey (Bag Raiders, Paloma Faith, Diplo.) The pandemic may have made it more challenging to collaborate, but Pip embraced the new ways of working and the result is for all to hear on TIME FLIES.<br><br>

The lockdown also encouraged Pip to join Twitch. It was a revelation, to be able to connect and find a true sense of community in an online world that has previously always been very daunting and confrontational. Twitch has provided a safe way to communicate and reach out to likeminded people such as fellow Twitch artists Shura, K.Flay and Woodes. <br><br>

TIME FLIES, due out October 8 on BMG, is an extraordinary collection that fuses intimate subject matter and upbeat guitar-led rock with irresistibly catchy electronic elements.<br><br>

If a new single and album isn’t enough good news for fans, a three-date NZ tour has also been announced, which will see Ladyhawke bring TIME FLIES to life across stages in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland this October. Pip expressed, “This is honestly something I could not see happening for ages, so here it is!! I am doing some shows!! I hope to see you all soon!!”<br><br>

Presented by Eccles Entertainment, tickets for Ladyhawke’s TIME FLIES tour go on sale at 12pm, Friday June 4 from https://ladyhawkemusic.com</p>

<p>Beloved indie band <strong>The Beths</strong> announce a very special club show at Karangahape Road’s Whammy Bar on Saturday 2 October, with support from Australian artist Stella Donnelly. </p>



<p style="text-align:center" class="has-medium-font-size">Tickets go on sale now at <a href="http://thebeths.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="thebeths.com (opens in a new tab)">thebeths.com</a></p>



<p> Elizabeth Stokes says, “<em>We are very happy to be heading back to the Whammy bar, the place where we grew from a baby band playing to a grown up band. We haven&#8217;t played there in a while so we will be channelling early Beths energy by nervously playing a couple of unreleased songs from the record we are working on currently and saying &#8216;this is a new one&#8217;. We hope that the audience will reciprocate in turn by singing along to their old favourites and accidentally spilling beer on the stage. It&#8217;s going to be fun.”</em><br><br> They may have started as a club band, but The Beths have played progressively larger New Zealand venues, particularly following the release of their Aotearoa Music Award-winning 2020 release Jump Rope Gazers (Album of the Year). The Beths also won Best Group and Best Alternative Act in 2019 and 2020. After selling out their Jump Rope Gazers album release show at the Powerstation in just six days, the band sold out venues around the country, wrapping up their biggest ever NZ headline tour at the iconic Auckland Town Hall. <br><br> Though they can command much bigger spaces, The Beths will return to one of their favourite venues from the early days, treating fans to an intimate show that will include tracks from Future Me Hates Me and Jump Rope Gazers, as well as brand new songs.<br></p>

<p>Exocative singer, ZÖ is back and eager to share an intimate new single &#8216;<em><strong>Origami</strong></em>&#8216;, a sign of what&#8217;s to come from her brand new EP that is set to release later in the year.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I have a tendency to be a little self deprecating, it&#8217;s the way its always been, so deep in mu subconscious&#8221; </em>she sings on Origami, openly sharing how she struggles with negative beliefs she&#8217;s holds towards herself. The vulnerability in the song pairs beautifully with her reassuring vocals, a lovely contrast yo yer powerful pop beats and catchy guitar riffs, with influences from London Grammar and Aurora.<br><br>Reflecting on the song, she says <em>&#8220;This song is about realising I need to work on myself, that I&#8217;m the only one who can make it happen, but sometimes I forget and slip bak into my old ways &#8230; sometime I just need someone to keep me accountable and help me through it.&#8221;</em><br><br>In 2019, ZÖ debuted a modest three-track EP that revealed what is at the heart of it all &#8211; to be unashamedly honestly and vulnerable in her music, inviting others to do the same. Not only that, but she solidified herself as an elegant songwriter who captures pre emotion bu documentation her inner conflicts and placing it into song form. Now 23 and based in Wellington, New Zealand, she&#8217;s set to continue her rise in delivering intimate and unfiltered pop music. </p>

<p>On a crisp Thursday night I went to the Basement studio, to see the opening night of Glamourpuss, an insight into a living with mental illness. The latest show from the much talked about &#8216;up and comer&#8217; Ruby Esther.</p>



<p>She started with what I would call the most confident introduction. Esther introduces herself as incredibly talented, which when you watch the show you will agree to be an interesting opening gambit, although admittedly quite a confident way to start a set, but the façade is down within minutes, revealing a truer representation of an anxious young woman, leaving the audience feeling safe and laughing within minutes.</p>



<p>Ruby doesn’t stray from talking about the challenging subjects. Her material includes skillfully crafted punchlines, which are framed within her own personal experiences, and often a witty take on those darker subjects. The result usually being a sigh of relief and a massive laugh from the audience. </p>



<p>Highlights from this show include two amazing songs that are guaranteed earworms that I found myself singing the next morning, and even as I am writing this review. She talked about a range of subjects, such as being misidentified as a boy in intermediate, passing her university degrees, and life as a young woman in comedy. </p>



<p>Glamourpuss is a pleasantly varied show, Esther uses a mix of stories and straight up gags, which wonderfully fluctuates between tone, so you never know if the next joke is a quick one-liner or a polished story. Esther was able to squeeze laughs out of even the toughest audience member, whether it be with her jokes, a quick anxious laugh, or reactive expression of anxiety.</p>



<p>Ruby and her ukulele is taking the New Zealand comedy scene by storm, catch Glamourpuss quickly before you miss out.</p>

<p>It was a crisp Tuesday evening when I walked up the stairs into the Q Theatre Rangatira to witness The Great Comedy Debate.</p>



<p>It has to be mentioned this show was funny for both myself and my grandma and she had just as much fun as my twenty-year-old self did, giving it multi generational appeal. It was a truly one size fits all comedy show.</p>



<p>The topic for the debate was &#8220;Technology will save us.&#8221; There were 2 teams, in the affirmative Joseph Moore, Hayley Sproull, and Jermaine Ross. On the negative team was Guy Williams, Alice Canton, and Laura Daniel. Te Radar was the moderator for the night.</p>



<p>The affirmative team was arguing that technology would save us. They started off strong with team captain Joseph Moore (half of Two Hearts) spinning hilarious yarns around the invention of the wheel, detailing how much technology has, and would save us. </p>



<p>Hayley Sproull came with an relatable tale of why we are all waiting for our parents/boomers to die. While this may have been daunting for a majority of the audience(who were boomers). She still managed to get even the toughest section of the crowd to agree with the waiting game. </p>



<p>They ended with possibly the best argument from Jermain Ross. He argued that technology would save us from discrediting the other side of the argument, showing proof that they were at the bombing of the rainbow warrior, and on the wrong side of the police riot.</p>



<p>Team led by Comedy’s favorite Montgomery. Montgomery bringing out inspirational tales of outdated times where technology failed to save us, such as during the titanic. During his rebuttal he masterly created come backs for each argument. In particular Ross, quipping that Ross had taken screenshots from some of his fondest memories. </p>



<p>Next to come up was Snorts&#8217; -Alice Canton starting off nervously. By the end of the argument she had me considering the unthinkable, concluding that we shouldn’t bother with technology, as we don’t deserve to be saved. Ultimately spreading a message of voluntary euthanasia for all. </p>



<p>The Negative team ended with Laura Daniels, (the other half of Two Hearts) who stormed into the stage with an hilarious melody about why technology is bad because of sex robots, and ultimately that we shouldn&#8217;t f#ck robots.</p>



<p>The night was sponsored by Lane Neave who advocated for audience interaction, providing paddles saying objection and concur. The night was skillfully rapped under the careful eye of Te Radar who skillfully commentated on proceedings, working off what each respective comedian said.</p>



<p>The Great Comedy Debate was a hilarious and informative hour of comedy. Each participant talented in their own right, wonderfully highlighting what they do best in as comedians. Definitely a show to catch should it come to the fest next year.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I made my way up top The Classic Studio to watch End Of Daze, a wonderfully heartfelt and vulnerable hour of  stand up comedy performed by Lolsy Byrne.</p>



<p>She began the show by describing the events that led her to be in New Zealand, having come over a year prior to perform this show, before plans changed due to the global pandemic.</p>



<p>In this show Byrne relives her childhood as a creative only child, and how sci fi led to anxieties over the end of the world compounding in 2012 when the world was supposed to end. She detailed her own disaster filled 2012, relating them to similar disasters in her life.</p>



<p>Byrne performs with her heart on her sleeve, with a refreshing openness and vulnerability, which combined with her chipper and playful nature makes her instantly likeable, making it easier to empathize and sympathize with her plights, both light and dark.</p>



<p>End Of Daze is an emotional rollercoaster, containing both mirth and tragedy. Lolsy Byrne takes us on a curated tour of her life leading us to laugh with her for the highs and lament with her for the lows. Recommended for fans of tragedy in comedy.</p>

<p>I found myself in the Q Theatre Loft on Tuesday night, on the final week of the 2021 New Zealand International Comedy Festival. I had come to see festival staple Eli Matthewson&#8217;s newest hour of comedy &#8216;Daddy-Short-Legs&#8217;. It was a packed out crowd, in what Matthewson described as &#8220;The biggest room he&#8217;s ever played in the festival.&#8221;</p>



<p>In Daddy-Short-Legs, Matthewson updates us on the recent goings on in his life, from his online presence, to major events in his family and relationships. He was accompanied by a screen and projector, which he used to punctuate some of his jokes with fitting and hilarious visuals.</p>



<p>The meat of the show related to Matthewson&#8217;s experiences as a &#8216;gay comedian&#8217;, and how that has affected both his personal and working life. In this he muses on the criticism that he only tells &#8216;gay jokes&#8217; and examines representation in popular culture.</p>



<p>Matthewson continues in his trend of being interesting and funny. Whether it be slipping in relevant facts or concepts within punchlines, or making jokes about obscure sculpting artists from Wellington, he is fantastic at making you laugh and think at the same time.</p>



<p>Daddy-Short-Legs is a combination of engaging anecdotes, top notch observations and fantastic one liners, guaranteeing an hour of being in stitches. Definitely a show to catch this festival.</p>

<p><br>It was a crisp Thursday night when I walked up the steep stairs of the classic studio, to see some of the best Christchurch comedy scene has to offer in The Porne Identity, starring Audrey Porne, and her fantastic opening act comedy veteran Gerrit Gray.</p>



<p>In his opening set Gerrit gives an insight to what its like being a disgruntled bouncer. I was impressed by his ability to seamlessly bouncing from quips, all while keeping the energy building. His set contained personal stories of being a self-proclaimed “Nice Guy”, and how to keep dates calm and relaxed as a competitive guy.</p>



<p>In The&nbsp;Porne&nbsp;Identity,&nbsp;Porne&nbsp;promised an unhinged, silly, and ‘way more fun than sitting at home experience’ and delivered this to a receptive audience in mere minutes of walking on stage.&nbsp;Porne&nbsp;takes the audience on a journey diving into her psyche. From stories of growing up in Invercargill the struggles of sobriety, familiar issues and tall guys.</p>



<p>She has mastered the craft of talking about these darker sides of herself through a rose-colored lens. This leaves the audiences both laughing and thinking, instead of becoming emotional and giving the inevitable empathetic aww. Porne clearly utilizes the mastery of her craft with amazing writing combined with an awe-inspiring performance.</p>



<p>I was constantly gasping for breath after laughing so hard after each hard-hitting punch line landed effortlessly. She ended the show with&nbsp;a feminist&nbsp;poem/erotica, earning her a well-deserved standing ovation in the crowd. Both Audrey&nbsp;Porne&nbsp;and Gerrit Gray have a bright future in comedy and are definitely acts to watch. I Recommend watching this show if you love an hour of comedy where your hands hurt from clapping and&nbsp;eyes water from&nbsp;laughing.</p>

<p>Further into the evening I made my to The Classic Studio to see Australian comic Laura Davis, in her show If This Is It, a wonderful meta analysis of the purpose of comedy and art during a global pandemic.</p>



<p>In this Davis explored her comedic origins in Australia, her travels to perform in London and Edinburgh, and how she ended up in New Zealand after Covid hit. She also examined the more &#8216;apocalyptic&#8217; aspects of the world, and mused of a series of entertaining hypotheticals, theories.= and observations.</p>



<p>She also provided spot on commentary on world politics, and the current state of stand up comedy. (and expectations on comedians) Her performance was at time brash and tenacious, and at times vulnerable, her delivery was at times poetic. She was excellent at using tone and her imaginative wit to make a point and, or just plain make people laugh.</p>



<p>If This Is It is a highly entertaining and thought provoking hour of comedy and feels like a complete work of art. Davis has the goods in the jokes department, bringing the audience in and keeping them for the journey and messages of the piece. Recommended for fans of longer form and thought provoking comedy.</p>

<p>Just after tea time on a Wednesday evening, I sauntered up the steps to the Basement Studio, to allow Ray Shipley and Emma Cusdin to whisk me back to Brunch.</p>



<p>In Brunch, Shipley and Cusdin try and piece together a pilot for a breakfast TV show, an endeavour which slowly goes array, a process which is an absolute delight to watch. This is performed via sketch, parody and interesting metaphors.</p>



<p>Both Shipley and Cusdin have an awkward charm to them, that makes them play so well off of each other, the banter performed seamlessly. The script was also fantastically self aware, providing excellent parody of the morning show format, and aptly lamp shading when their pilot goes wrong.</p>



<p>One aspect I particularly enjoyed was the cheesy smiles they wore after every &#8220;ad break&#8221; and watching the facades slowly slip away as things went further and further south. Also their use of Lovely Day by Bill Withers as their theme song, a song that I sporadically got stuck in my head throughout the early to mid 2000s. (But that&#8217;s just a bit about me)</p>



<p>In a festival chocked full of stand up and Improv it is pretty refreshing to see some theatre. Brunch is a wonderfully light hearted mixture of theatre and comedy that leaves you wondering friendship or breakfast.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>MEET THE LINE-UP</strong></p>



<p><strong>MC Slave</strong><br><br> A man of many parts, Mark James Williams aka MC Slave/ aka Uncle Mark aka Logg Cabin has touched on, and triumphed in, most areas of the media during a career that has spanned the best part of three decades. Mark first emerged in the public eye of Aotearoa as the Slavish half of proto hip hop duo MC OJ &amp; Rhythm Slave. With a slew of releases on the Southside label and pioneering shows up and down the country, they developed into Joint Force in combination with long time compadre DLT. Ready and able to MC at a moment’s notice and never far from a mic, Slave found his eventual ideal musical home with Wellington troubadours Fat Freddy’s Drop, carving out a position as their much celebrated hype man/tour MC since 2006. As well as providing the live lyrical fire and crowd incentivising for FFD, Mark has also warmed the stage up for them all over the world as a DJ / Selector. Most weekends you’ll find Slave raising the roof and stirring the dancefloor around Auckland or beyond, or hosting his iconic radio show, The Loggcabin.<br><br><strong>Ché-Fu</strong> <br>With the most top 10 songs of any individual in New Zealand music history, Ché-Fu is one of the country’s most successful and beloved recording artists. Originally coming to the attention of Aotearoa in the early 90&#8217;s as one of the original members of iconic Kiwi rock band Supergroove, Ché-Fu went on to forge a career as a solo-artist writing and recording hip hop/soul chart topping songs such as ‘Chains’ and ‘Misty Frequencies’, and platinum selling albums such as 2B S. PACIﬁC and THE NAVIGATOR. Ché continues to perform on the NZ and Australasian circuit with his band the Kratez, and as an MC, and a DJ.<br><br> <strong>King Kapisi </strong><br>A stalwart of the NZ music scene, King Kapisi has spent the past 15 years travelling the world representing Kiwi music on an international stage. He has performed at festivals throughout the world including the largest Northern Hemisphere outdoor festival, Glastonbury (U.K) and the largest indie music industry event in the USA, SXSW (Austin, TX). Kapisi has won many awards including APRA Songwriter of the Year (1999) for ‘Reverse Resistance’.<br><br><strong>Ria</strong> <strong>Hall</strong> <br>Ria Hall is a trailblazing artist whose debut album, 2017’s RULES OF ENGAGEMENT earned her the 2018 APRA Maioha Award for Songwriting, and Best Female Solo Artist at the Waiata Māori Music Awards. Her second album, 2020’s MANAWA WERA received critical acclaim and saw her pick up Te Tohu Manu Tioriori Wāhine Autaia (Best Māori Female Solo Artist Award) at the Waiata Māori Music Awards, and was a finalist for the coveted Taite Music Prize 2021.<br><br><strong>Rubi Du </strong><br>Well known Auckland reggae artist Rubi Du has been making waves in music here in New Zealand and overseas, and most recently on a successful tour with NZ&#8217;s kings of dub, Fat Freddy&#8217;s Drop. Formerly known as SilvaMC, Rubi has solidified herself as the Queen of New Zealand&#8217;s roots and dancehall scene and continues to blow audience minds as a vocalist and emcee with electrifying live performances. Her Caribbean heritage and Rastafarian childhood have helped to shape her unique and unforgettable style, while staying true to her Kiwi roots.<br><br><strong>Tali</strong> <br>Tali is an award-winning singer-songwriter and highly sought-after for her experience as one of the most prolific Female MC/Vocalists to emerge from the International Electronic Dance music scene &#8211; particularly for her work and ground-breaking achievements within Drum and Bass. Tali has worked with some of the biggest names in Drum and Bass and toured the world several times over as both an MC and with a live band. She’s released seven studio albums, won three Drum and Bass awards, a NZ Music Award for her latest LP LOVE &amp; MIGRATION, had a UK top 40 hit and is one of handful of female artists to ever grace the cover of DJ Mag International. Tali&#8217;s soulful uplifting voice, and spitfire lyrics, and mix of contemporary and classic Drum and Bass tracks is always a crowd pleaser.<br><br><strong>DJ Manchoo </strong><br>DJ Manchoo is one of the most prolific and recognised DJs in Aotearoa. The DJ, turntablist, mixer, scratcher and beat juggler has a long list of accolades to his name including two times ITF New Zealand DJ Champion, DMC New Zealand Champion and NZ Red Bull 3style runner-up. DJ Manchoo is also a long-standing and well respected radio personality and DJ and will definitely bring the noise to Breaks N’ Brass with his incredible skills.<br><br><strong>The Breaking Brass Orchestra </strong><br>The Breaking Brass Orchestra is fronted by four phenomenal singers &#8211; Iri Aumatangi, Bella Kalolo, Ella Monnery and Syah Folau. The Breaking Brass Orchestra also features the phatest rhythm section in Aotearoa (Jacob Nansen &#8211; keys, Ross Nansen &#8211; drums, Isaac Etimani &#8211; bass, Jess Hicks &#8211; percussion); backing a dynamic, knockout 16-piece horn section, led by award-winning musical director, guitarist Dixon Nacey. Performing brand new arrangements of Hip Hop and R&#8217;n&#8217;B 90&#8217;s club bangers, the Breaking Brass Orchestra will blow your mind and blow you away!<br><br><strong>Freshmans Dance Crew</strong><br> Freshmans Dance Crew are a group of dancers and choreographers who are pushing to create a new vibe in the Street Dance scene in New Zealand. From competitions to theatre, Freshmans explore uncharted territories in the Street Dance industry and continue to impress the world with their incredible movement. In 2014 they captured multiple national titles and represented New Zealand at the HHI World Hip Hop Championships in Las Vegas. </p>

<p> Here we are at second week of comedy fest, fully satiated with variety of comedy I caught week 1, I ventured to my first outing of week 2, Bec Sandys&#8217; latest show, Happy Cabbage.</p>



<p>Happy Cabbage is a series of stories of Sandys&#8217; life, highlighting the more bizarre moments. In this she explores drug use, small town life in Ashburton, and the variety of bogans. Combining relevant observations, one liners and anecdotes. The show mines nostalgia for the 80s and 90s, a now bygone era, which feels recent and yet some aspects seem alien to the modern day.</p>



<p>Sandys&#8217; is a fantastic story teller, skillfully mining her life for humour, managing to weave in a fitting quip or comment on popular culture. In Happy Cabbage she is wonderfully open about her experiences, reminiscing about the fun times, and more questionable times in her life. Her stories were vivid, almost as if she was curating a museum of her life.</p>



<p>Happy Cabbage is a highly engaging show, that highlights Bec Sandys&#8217; sublime ability to tell stories, this show almost serves as a personal time capsule for the 80s/90s, and is an entertaining ride. Recommended for fans of candid comedy, story telling, and I think you&#8217;ll get an extra kick out of it if you come from a small town. (Particularly in rural New Zealand)</p>

<p> It was late on Friday when I entered the Loft at Q Theatre to watch This Will Be Tested, a double bill featuring two of Auckland&#8217;s freshest up and comers, Chester Jerrat (Finalist of TVNZ&#8217;s New Blood) and Sarah Hughes (Winner of the 2019 Raw Comedy Quest).</p>



<p>The show began with Jerrat and Hughes introducing themselves to the audience, engaging in banter and chatting with members of the audience. In theme with the show they asked questions about performance in school, managing to gather interesting stories from audience members, coming back with a handy quip. Their back and forth was seamless, creating a sort of tennis match of gags, which I found highly entertaining.</p>



<p>Jerrat was the first to perform a set, performing with his fresh youthful perspective. He mused on some of his more ridiculous experiences in student living, and during his childhood. He has a particular knack for spotting inconsistencies and nit picking them to their extremes.</p>



<p>Hughes was second to perform, and displayed her ability to breakdown interesting information and deliver it in an entertaining format. In this she explored her own biblical namesake, and deconstructing bible stories in the modern context. She combined this with stories from high school and being a millennial adult, which were incredibly relatable and engaging. She is a performer that revels in her own embarrassment, in a way that is wonderfully honest and charming.</p>



<p> This Will Be Tested was a very entertaining hour of comedy with an interesting variety of perspectives. Both Chester Jerrat and Sarah Hughes are up and comers to keep an eye on for the future.</p>

<p>On Friday Night I found myself in a packed out Classic, full of lively punters to watch Rhys Mathewson, the Heartless Joke Machine. The liveliness of the crowd would set to the tone for the night, and Mathewson&#8217;s reaction to it would show the caliber of comic he is.</p>



<p>The show was billed as being &#8220;Jam packed with jokes, jokes, jokes.&#8221; and it delivered in this regard, Mathewson showing his repertoire from the get go, displaying his mastery of story telling, one liners, observations and physical mime. </p>



<p>What most impressed me was how he was able to roll with the punches. As I alluded to, the Classic was full of Friday night punters, and lively punters at that. The night was full of heckles, misplaced clapping and just general buffoonery. While not ideal, Mathewson has the experience and ability to recover from the loss of momentum, and keep the show rolling, while squeezing a bit of extra humour from &#8220;addressing the elephant in the room.&#8221; </p>



<p>Heartless Joke Machine is probably the best structured show I have seen so far in the fest. Mathewson entertaining us into following him on a journey, as he revealed recent major events of his life, and explored how being a comic factored in, while hiding a subtle arc throughout.</p>



<p>Heartless Joke Machine was a solid, Edinburgh level hour of comedy. Rhys Mathewson is one of New Zealand&#8217;s most talented comics, his natural physicality, engagingly high energy delivery and world class joke writing ability are some of the many feathers in his cap, not forgetting his ability to tame some of the rowdiest crowds.</p>
